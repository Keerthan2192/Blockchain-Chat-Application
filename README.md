## Running the Project

### Set Up the Blockchain

1. **Configure a Ganache**: Use Ganache for local development or connect to a public testnet like Ropsten.

2. **Initialize the blockchain**: Ensure the blockchain is running and accessible. Update the `index.html` script with the appropriate connection details.

### Start the Application

1. **Run the `index.html` script**: This script starts the application.
   
2. **Access the web interface**: Open your browser and navigate to the specified address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`) to start using the chat application.

### Using the Chat Application

1. **Choose which block you want to message **: Then send the message with hash of the block.
2. **Send and receive messages**: Use the web interface to send messages. The messages will be secured and verified using the blockchain.
