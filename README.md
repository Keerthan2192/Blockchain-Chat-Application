# Blockchain-Chat-Application
A secure and decentralized web chat application leveraging blockchain technology. This repository provides the tools and code necessary to build, deploy, and manage a blockchain-based messaging system, ensuring privacy, data integrity, and resistance to censorship.
Features
Decentralized Messaging: Utilizes blockchain to decentralize message storage and transmission, eliminating central points of failure.
Security: Employs encryption and blockchain immutability to ensure secure communication.
Transparency: All transactions and messages are transparently recorded on the blockchain.
User Authentication: Blockchain-based authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of messages efficiently.
Technologies Used
Blockchain: Core technology for decentralization and security.
Smart Contracts: For managing chat functionalities and user interactions.
Ethereum/Solana/Other: Blockchain platforms used for deploying smart contracts.
Web3.js: To interact with the blockchain from the client-side.
React: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
Node.js: Backend server for handling API requests and blockchain interactions.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js to build the backend API.
Socket.io: Real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
