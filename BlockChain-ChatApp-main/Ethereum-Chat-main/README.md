# Ethereum Chat

### What is Chather?
Chather is a secure distributed chat client running on the Ethereum blockchain. Chather leverages Smart Contracts to create a chat application without a central server. Messages sent to the blockchain cannot be modified or faked, ensuring complete security.

### What technologies does Chather use?
The Chather smart contract is built using Solidity. This contract is currently running on the Ethereum blockhain and functions as the backend. The frontend is written using AngularJS, jQuery, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### Installation Instructions
To run Chather yourself, host the static web files and navigate to the index. If you want to try hosting Chather on your localhost, you can use https://github.com/indexzero/http-server to test it out. Chather requires that MetaMask is installed in order to query the blockchain.
